# Docker Compose

The Compose file is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file defining [services](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/compose-file/index.md#service-configuration-reference), [networks](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/compose-file/index.md#network-configuration-reference) and [volumes](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/compose/compose-file/index.md#volume-configuration-reference). The default path for a Compose file is `./docker-compose.yml`.

**Tip**: You can use either a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension for this file. They both work.

A service definition contains configuration that is applied to each container started for that service, much like passing command-line parameters to `docker container create`. Likewise, network and volume definitions are analogous to `docker network create` and `docker volume create`.

As with `docker container create`, options specified in the Dockerfile, such as `CMD`, `EXPOSE`, `VOLUME`, `ENV`, are respected by default - you don't need to specify them again in `docker-compose.yml`.
